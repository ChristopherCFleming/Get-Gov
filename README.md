Disclaimer: I am not married to this idea, it's just the thing that kept popping into my head when I thought of it. Please feel free to tell me this is not a good project. 

Buckle up, a/A, it's gonna get weird. I need to preface this example by saying I'm against Nazis and do not approve of white washing the past, but this is such a good example of what I want to do. Please watch till at least until at least the 37 second mark because that's where it peaks.

Here's my idea: use this deepfake technology to make pictures of my favorite politicians (Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders) sing either Taylor Swift's Shake it Off or Pharell's Happy. I hope to also make it so a user can snap a pic of themselves and do it too.

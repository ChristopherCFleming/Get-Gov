        Welcome to Get Gov. Please enter your address to find all your representatives listed below. These elected officials are tasked to represent your interests in our government. They work for you. To best do their job, it's important they have a clear idea of what it is that will win your approval and ultimately your vote. Let them know what's on your mind!
        <br>
        <br>
        While the roles of state and federal governments are often intertwined, think of the federal level as serving two roles: 1) set basic standards for the entire country and 2) direct funding to each state.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reach out to these representatives to discuss any of the following topics: Mediare for All, A Green New Deal, Net Neutrality, civil rights, voting rights, international relations, federal taxes, federal court appointments.

        Below you can find all your state level representatives. The United States gives huge powers of interpretation to each state to administer federal laws how they see fit. For example, the federal government demands that a worker must be paid a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The state of New Hampsire follows this guideline and has a minimum wage of $7.25, but in the state of New York the minimum wage is $15.00 per hour. Additionally, states may enact their own laws so long as they don't conflict with existing federal laws. For example, abortion rights are granted by the federal government, but certain states make it more difficult to obtain one. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Think of each state government almost like a mini version of the federal government, except instead of a president we have governors. Your local representatives must 1) tailor federal laws to fit the state's needs and 2) make new laws.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Feel free to reach out to these representatives to discuss the following topics: state taxes, redistricting, unemployment insurance, libraries, parks, city planning, education.
